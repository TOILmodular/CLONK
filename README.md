# CLONK
This Eurorack module is based on the "Delayed Modulation" design from Music From Outerspace (Ray Wilson), combined with a simple squarewave sound source and an OTA filter.

It can be used for metallic percussive sounds. It also has separate outputs from an attack-release/decay envelope generator, as well as from an LFO, modulated by that AD, which can be used itself as a CV modulation source.

The module also provides the option to add an external sound source, instead of the internal squarewave oscillator, and an external modulation source, instead of the internal LFO.

The following graph shows the signal flow within the module.
